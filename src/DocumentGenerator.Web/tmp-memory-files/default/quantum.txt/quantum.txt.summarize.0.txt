A quantum computer is a computer that utilizes quantum mechanical phenomena, such as quantum superposition and entanglement, to perform calculations. It can potentially solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. However, the current state of quantum computing is largely experimental and faces obstacles to practical applications. The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, which can exist in a superposition of its two states. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging due to quantum decoherence. Promising technologies for qubits include superconductors and ion traps. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity, where some quantum algorithms require exponentially fewer computational steps than classical algorithms for specific tasks. However, quantum speedup is not universal and practical use cases are limited. Optimism about quantum computing is tempered by the understanding of its limitations, particularly the impact of noise and the need for quantum error-correction.
